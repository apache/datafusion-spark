Contributions are welcome. See also the
[DataFusion contributor guide](https://datafusion.apache.org/contributor-guide/).

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing these functions, you can check if there are existing implementations
in the [Sail] or [Comet] projects first. If you do port functionality from these
sources, make sure to port over the corresponding tests too, to ensure correctness
and compatibility.

### `simplify()`

DataFusion functions allow you to implement `simplify()` which can let you rewrite
the function call during logical optimization, theoretically allowing you to avoid
implementing physical execution via `invoke_with_args()` if the rewrite is unconditional
(e.g. rewrite to an arithmetic operation).

**However, `invoke_with_args()` must always be implemented for functions in this
crate.** This is because downstream users such as Comet rely on DataFusion for physical
execution, and not logical planning/optimization. That means if a function doesn't
have a physical implementation (`invoke_with_args()`) it is not usable by Comet.

### Supported types

The functions in this crate need only support input types available to Spark; that
is, they do not need to handle unsigned types or types such as `Float16` or `Decimal64`.

## Documentation Guidelines

Every function should have documentation that appears in generated function references
(`ScalarUDFImpl::documentation()`, or the aggregate/window equivalent). Write it once, using the
`#[user_doc]` attribute macro from `datafusion-macros` on the struct, which generates
`documentation()` and keeps the docs next to the type. The struct keeps only a short rustdoc
comment (what it is, plus a link to the Spark docs), so that facts are not written twice.

The most useful thing to document is **how the function differs from the DataFusion built-in of
the same name**, and its Spark edge-case behavior. Only document behavior that is covered by a
test.

```rust
use datafusion_macros::user_doc;

/// Spark-compatible `my_func` expression.
///
/// <https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/sql/index.html#my_func>
#[user_doc(
    doc_section(label = "String Functions"),
    description = "What it returns, and how it differs from the DataFusion built-in: types, \
        NULL handling, edge cases (out-of-range values, overflow, empty input), ANSI mode.",
    syntax_example = "my_func(expr[, optional])",
    alternative_syntax = "alias(expr)", // only if there are aliases
    sql_example = r#"```sql
> SELECT my_func('a');
result
```"#,
    argument(name = "expr", description = "What it is, accepted types, NULL behavior.")
)]
#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq, Hash)]
pub struct SparkMyFunc { /* ... */ }

impl ScalarUDFImpl for SparkMyFunc {
    fn documentation(&self) -> Option<&Documentation> {
        self.doc()
    }
    // ...
}
```

See `sha2` (`crates/spark/src/function/hash/sha2.rs`) and `substring`
(`crates/spark/src/function/string/substring.rs`) for complete examples.

The function reference in [`docs/functions.md`](docs/functions.md) is generated from these
attributes. After adding or changing a function's documentation, regenerate it and commit the
result (CI checks that it is up to date):

```shell
dev/update_function_docs.sh
```

The script also lists, on stderr, the functions that don't implement `documentation()` yet.

## Testing Guidelines

Prefer adding tests via SQLLogicTests where possible, see the [Spark SQLLogicTest README].
Resort to adding tests as Rust unit tests where it is impossible or difficult to
test via SLT. This is because direct invocation via Rust skips steps such as input
coercion, and is usually more verbose in the setup needed to pass data in (and
assert output data).
